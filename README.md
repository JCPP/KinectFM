KinectFM
========

An innovative Kinect File Manager.

The program will deal with the on-screen display of some files with which the user can interact by means of gestures captured by Kinect.

The functions provided by the application will be:
* Navigating folders on the default partition;
* Selecting one or more files;
* Implementation of file operations (copy/paste/cut/move/delete).

Future features:
* Creating a folder;
* Viewing files with the most important extensions;
* Shortcuts for fast navigation;
* Scanning text;
* Voice gesture.
